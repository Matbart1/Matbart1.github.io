        <div>
            Being a lifeguard for years after graduating highschool, I quickly found myself
            needing a challenge to stimulate my mind, I spent some time with an owner of a computer
            repair store and with his guidance cultivated a love for computer hardware and software.

        <div>
            Currently, I'm in my final year of Computer Engineering Technologies at the technical college NAIT in Edmonton,
            the coursework is incredibly challenging and fast paced so in the blink of an eye most semesters seem to just fly by.
            The professors and peers I've gotten to interact with have been pivotal in my career, furthering my unending love for 
            computer programming.

          <h4>Future:</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            My plans going forward are to specialize in IT and Software, I am going to be taking many Udemy courses to supplement
            these aspirations. I believe it will be in my best interest to learn React for front-end development, and continue my love
            for OOP with C# in the back-end.
